# N queen problem using backtracking 
Solving N queen problem using backtracking algorithm. 
Layout of the board is chess-like and input for starting queen position needs to follow chess-like format e.g. "a1", "c7"...
Time complexity is O(n!). 
Please note that the most representative version is the one in C. The other ones serve just as demos.
Also see my algorithms visualized repository to see visualization of backtracking algorithm solving N Queen problem.
