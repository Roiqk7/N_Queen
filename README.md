# N_Queens
This is backtracking algorithm which solves N queens problem.
I would not recomend going beyond N = 22, which is also hardcoded as upper bound. The algorithm is very slow and I am open for recomendations.
Please note that if you want to to enter starting position use chesboard format meaning top left position is 'a1' and top right is up to 'zN'.
