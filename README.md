# N queen problem using backtracking 
Solving N queen problem using backtracking algorithm. 
Layout of the board is chess-like and input for starting queen position needs to follow chess-like format e.g. "a1", "c7"...
Complexity of both python and c algorithms is O(n!). 
Please note that functionality of python, c# and c solutions differ.
